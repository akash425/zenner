# API Service

## Responsibility

The API Service provides the primary interface for external clients and internal services to interact with the platform. This service handles:

- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Exposing well-defined HTTP endpoints for platform functionality
- **Request Routing**: Directing incoming requests to appropriate handlers
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Managing user authentication and access control
- **Request Validation**: Validating input data and ensuring data integrity
- **Response Formatting**: Standardizing API responses and error handling
- **Service Orchestration**: Coordinating with other services to fulfill client requests
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**: Managing API usage and preventing abuse

This service acts as the gateway to the platform, providing a unified and secure interface for all external interactions.
