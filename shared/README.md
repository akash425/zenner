# Shared

## Responsibility

The Shared folder contains common code, utilities, and resources that are used across multiple services in the platform. This includes:

- **Common Libraries**: Reusable code modules and functions shared between services
- **Shared Models**: Data models, schemas, and type definitions used across services
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions and utilities for common operations
- **Configuration**: Shared configuration files and constants
- **Protocol Definitions**: API contracts, message formats, and communication protocols
- **Testing Utilities**: Common test fixtures, mocks, and testing helpers
- **Documentation**: Shared documentation and design specifications

This folder promotes code reuse, consistency, and maintainability across the platform by centralizing common functionality and avoiding duplication.
